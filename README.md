MT19937

This is a repository to save off my final project from my Cryptography class at Mount Mercy University. 
My project is an implementation of the Mersenne Twister 19937 (MT19937) Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) algorithm, a basic exclusive-or (XOR) stream cipher using MT as the keystream generator, and a hacking tool to break the encryption with a known plaintext attack.
